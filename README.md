Coding exercises using the scanner

These exercises are provided to give you practice applying the skills you have learned in this course, but you will not submit them to your instructor nor will they be graded.

While you should ideally complete all exercises on this page, only the first and last exercises are required to check your understanding of the tools.

If you do not have problems completing the first and last exercises, you can move on to the next part of the course.
If you have problems with the first exercise, review the course content up to this point and try again.
If you have problems with the last exercise, complete all exercises in the order presented and try again.
Contact an instructor or TA if you have questions about any of the exercises or cannot resolve problems on your own.
Remember to sync your code with your classwork repository as you complete each exercise.
